class_name UnitType
extends Resource
## Static properties of one unit kind (infantry, tank, ...).
## Pure data: usable from the simulation core and from tests.
## Combat stats (weapons, damage chart rows) arrive in M3.

## Movement domains. Where `move_class` says which tiles a unit may enter, the
## domain says what *kind* of thing it is, and three rules ask: which properties
## service it (TerrainType.services), whether the ground below it is cover it
## gets to keep (CombatResolver), and whether an empty tank strands it or kills
## it (TurnRules).
const LAND := &"land"
const AIR := &"air"
const SEA := &"sea"

@export var id: StringName
@export var display_name: String
## Single character representing this unit in .txt map [units] sections.
@export var symbol: String
@export var cost: int = 0
@export var move_points: int = 0
@export var move_class: StringName = TerrainType.FOOT
## Which of LAND / AIR / SEA this unit is. See the constants above.
@export var domain: StringName = LAND
@export var vision: int = 2
## Infantry and mechs capture properties (used from M4).
@export var can_capture: bool = false
## Weapon range in tiles; 0/0 means unarmed (APC). min_range > 1 = indirect:
## cannot move and fire, never counters, and is never countered.
@export var min_range: int = 0
@export var max_range: int = 0
## Fuel tank; movement spends fuel equal to the terrain cost of each step.
@export var max_fuel: int = 99
## Fuel burned at the start of every one of this unit's turns, before it is
## resupplied. Zero for anything that can simply park — a plane cannot, which is
## what makes an airport worth taking. See TurnRules.begin_turn for the order.
@export var fuel_upkeep: int = 0
## Upkeep while submerged, for units that can dive. Meaningfully higher than the
## surface rate: staying down is what a sub trades fuel for.
@export var dived_fuel_upkeep: int = 0
## Whether this unit can submerge — the Sub, and nothing else.
@export var can_dive: bool = false
## Whether this unit's weapon reaches a submerged target. Everything else on the
## board simply cannot engage a dived sub, which is the point of diving.
@export var can_hit_submerged: bool = false
## Primary ammo; 0 means the weapon needs no ammo (or the unit is unarmed).
@export var max_ammo: int = 0
## How many passengers this unit can carry (APC = 1).
@export var transport_capacity: int = 0
## Move classes this unit can carry. An APC and a T-Copter take foot and boot;
## a Lander takes anything that drives. Empty means it carries nothing, which
## `transport_capacity` also has to agree with before a load is legal.
@export var cargo_classes: Array[StringName] = []
## Terrain ids this transport may unload onto. Empty means anywhere its cargo can
## stand, which is every transport but the Lander — a landing craft puts vehicles
## ashore on a beach or a quay, never over the side into open water.
@export var unload_terrain: Array[StringName] = []
## Supply units (APC) refill adjacent friendlies at turn start and on demand.
@export var can_resupply: bool = false
## Column of this unit in the generated units atlas texture.
@export var atlas_col: int = 0
## Which weapon signature the battle cut-in fires this unit with — a key into
## data/battle_anim/, resolved by BattleStyleDB in the presentation layer.
##
## A presentation key on a data resource, exactly like `atlas_col` above, and for
## the same reason: the roster is the one place that knows a Rocket is a Rocket,
## and neither a column number nor a puff of smoke is a rule. Nothing in core/ or
## ai/ reads this, and the style it names carries no gameplay number to read.
## Defaults to unarmed, so a unit that forgets to declare one stages quietly
## rather than firing something it does not own.
@export var battle_style: StringName = &"unarmed"
## The infinite-ammo secondary's presentation signature. Like battle_style,
## this is an opaque replay key and carries no combat value.
@export var secondary_battle_style: StringName = &"unarmed"


## True when running dry destroys this unit rather than merely stranding it.
## A plane falls out of the sky and a ship is lost; a tank just stops, which is
## how every land unit behaved before air and sea existed.
func lost_when_dry() -> bool:
	return domain != LAND


## True when this unit can carry `carried_class`. Capacity is a separate
## question — see GameState.cargo_of — but a transport that carries nothing is
## not a transport whatever its capacity says.
func can_carry(carried_class: StringName) -> bool:
	return transport_capacity > 0 and carried_class in cargo_classes


## True when this transport may put cargo ashore while standing on `terrain_id`.
## An empty `unload_terrain` means anywhere — the APC and the T-Copter, which
## unload wherever the passenger can stand.
func can_unload_from(terrain_id: StringName) -> bool:
	return unload_terrain.is_empty() or terrain_id in unload_terrain
