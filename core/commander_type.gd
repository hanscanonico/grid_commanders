class_name CommanderType
extends Resource
## One general: who they are, the Command Power they charge toward, and the
## hooks their doctrine is expressed through.
##
## This base class *is* the neutral commander. Every hook returns the value the
## rules had before commanders existed, so a side that picked no CO plays
## exactly as it did before this file — resolvers call the hooks unconditionally
## and never branch on "does this team have a commander".
##
## Each general is a small subclass in core/commanders/ overriding two or three
## of these, with its balance numbers as @export on a .tres in data/commanders/:
## behaviour in typed classes, numbers in data, like the rest of the repo.
##
## Three rules hold for every hook here:
##
## 1. Simulation state only. Never a Node, never a scene — this is core/.
## 2. Integer percentage points, never floats, so no doctrine can drift the
##    damage numbers a golden-value test pins down.
## 3. A hook checks `_is_active()` itself. A Command Power is not a separate
##    system; it is "this hook returns a bigger number while the power runs".
##
## `_is_active` and the `_can_*` predicates below are the subclass toolkit rather
## than hooks — underscored because nothing outside this hierarchy calls them.

## Inclusive bounds of the standard combat luck roll. They live here rather than
## on CombatResolver because a doctrine may narrow or shift the range (Lyra
## Quill), which makes them commander data.

## for that movement class. Called from the Dijkstra flood fill *and* from the
## fuel spend in GameState.advance_unit, so a discount never leaves fuel
## disagreeing with the path the player was shown.

## The default is the offensive read — "there is a fight to have this turn" —
## which is correct for every power whose value lands on the turn it fires: the
## attack and movement doctrines. The powers that are not about this turn's
## fight override it, and each does so in its own subclass, so a general's sense
## of timing lives beside the rest of its doctrine instead of in the planner.

# Advisory hooks the computer planner may ask, on wants_power's terms:
# rule-based, lookahead-free, RNG-free, and reading only what the planner
# already reads — anything of the enemy's goes through Vision.is_hidden_from,
# never around it. The base class advises nothing, so the neutral commander and
# any general with no opinion leave planning bit-for-bit unchanged; the planner
# scales every answer by its own doctrine_weight and skips the hooks entirely
# at zero. A hook never reads the damage chart: expected damage is the
# forecast's job, and the forecasts already carry every combat hook above, so
# advice that re-priced one would count the same doctrine twice.

## army shoots *and* in whose army is being shot at, and reusing one filter for

## `ready_only` limits the attackers to units that have not acted, which is the
## right question about the side whose turn it is and the wrong one about the
## side waiting to reply.
##
## Reach is Manhattan distance against movement plus firing range, ignoring
## terrain cost. It over-estimates deliberately: the failure worth avoiding is a
## commander sitting on a full meter all match.

## cannot see. Vision owns that judgement; it is not re-derived here.
