class_name MapCatalog
extends RefCounted
## The shipped map roster: which files under maps/ are maps, what they are
## called, and the order the menu offers them in.
##
## Adding a map is still dropping a .txt in maps/ — nothing here lists them by
## hand. The point of the class is that the menu, the map lint and the per-map
## AI soak all discover the roster through one function instead of three
## DirAccess loops that can drift apart.
##
## Node-free like the rest of core/, so tests read exactly what the menu reads.

const MAPS_DIR := "res://maps"
## The teaching board pinned to item zero in `ordered()`. The menu reads this
## same key for its START HERE badge, so ordering and explanation cannot drift.
const BEGINNER_MAP_PATH := "res://maps/first_steps.txt"
## Boards that exist to be measured on rather than played: the balance fixtures.
## Deliberately a subdirectory, because `paths()` below scans only the top level
## — so a fixture is reachable by name from the offline tools and the battle
## scene, and still absent from the menu, the map lint and the per-map AI soak.
const FIXTURES_DIR := "res://maps/fixtures"


## Every shipped map, alphabetically by filename — a stable order that does not
## depend on the filesystem's. `ordered()` is what the menu shows.

## The roster parsed with the teaching board first, then smallest board first.
## Item zero is the menu's default, so first contact should open on the board
## written to teach the game rather than merely the shortest duel. The rest keep
## the established data-derived order; ties break on filename.
## Maps that fail to parse are dropped with a pushed error rather than taking
## the menu down with them.

## instruments.
##
## The single answer to "which board is `ironworks`?", so the offline balance
## tools and the battle scene resolve a spec identically — a watched match has to
## be played on the same board its headless row was, and two resolvers would
## eventually disagree about that.
