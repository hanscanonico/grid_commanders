class_name CaptureCommand
extends Command
## Moves a capture-capable unit onto a property and chips at its capture
## points. Reaching zero flips ownership; taking the enemy HQ wins the match.


## The snapshot the capture cut-in replays (plan D1). Filled by apply() at the
## moment the sim commits the numbers, and read only by the presentation layer —
## nothing in core/ or ai/ touches it, exactly as AttackCommand.result is read
## only by the animator. The cut-in must replay these, never recompute them: a
## second opinion on capture math is the bug class this repo already paid for
## once with movement.
class CaptureResult:
	## Capture points remaining before and after this action, 0-20. `points_after`
	## is clamped at zero, so `points_before - points_after` is the honest count
	## the meter drains by — and the chips sum to — even when a strong unit
	## overshoots the last few points.
	var points_before := 0
	var points_after := 0
	## Who owned the property going in, for the atlas row the cut-in shows before
	## the flip. On a partial capture it is the owner throughout.
	var owner_before := 0
	## True when this action flipped ownership — the completing capture.
	var captured := false
