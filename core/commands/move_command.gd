## Validates everything about moving `unit` along `path` except the
## destination-occupancy rule, which each movement-type command (Move, Load,
## Join) defines for itself. Returns "" when legal.
##
## Step cost and the movement budget both come from MovementResolver, never from
## the terrain or the unit type directly. That is not a stylistic preference:
## the flood fill is what produced the path being checked here, so anything this
## works out for itself is a second opinion, and a doctrine that changes movement
## makes the two disagree — the range overlay offers a cell and the command then
## refuses it.
