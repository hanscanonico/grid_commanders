class_name DropCommand
extends Command
## Moves a transport, then unloads its passenger onto an adjacent cell.
## The passenger comes out exhausted, like Advance Wars.
##
## Two terrain rules, and they are different questions. The cargo has to be able
## to *stand* where it lands, which every transport shares; and the transport has
## to be somewhere it can unload *from*, which is only the Lander's problem — a
## landing craft beaches on a shoal or ties up at a port, and cannot tip a tank
## over the side mid-ocean. Both come from data, so neither is a special case.

var path: Array[Vector2i]
var drop_cell: Vector2i
## Which passenger to unload. Left null it means the first loaded, which is what a
## single-slot transport always drops; a Lander holds two, and either might be the
## one that can stand where the other cannot, so the caller names it explicitly.
