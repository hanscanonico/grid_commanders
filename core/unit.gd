## Submerged (subs only). A dived unit is hidden from enemies that are not
## standing next to it — with or without fog, unlike everything else the fog
## rules hide — and only a weapon that reaches under the surface can touch it.
## It still occupies its cell: an enemy that moves into it finds it there. That
## blocking is visible even when the boat is not — with fog off the move-range
## overlay shows a one-tile hole where it sits, which gives its position away.
## Known and accepted: the proper answer is the trap behaviour a hidden unit has
## in Advance Wars, where moving into one halts you there, and that is deferred.

## The single definition of "running dry". The board's warning badge, the tile
