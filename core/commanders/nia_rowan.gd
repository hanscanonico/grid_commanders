## Verdant League. Terrain doctrine: her foot units treat the difficult ground
## everyone else avoids as ordinary, so woods and mountains become her road
## network rather than an obstacle. Ghost March adds sight to that mobility for
## a turn, and lifts the rule that woods hide what is more than a tile away.
##
## No combat modifier at all — everything she does is positional.

## Deliberately id-keyed: this is a flavour list, "rough going", and no terrain
## flag states that — inventing one for a single doctrine would be a flag with
## one reader. Unlike Sable Wren's cover, this is not the concealment rule.

## Ghost March buys ground and sight rather than damage, so a property she can
## take counts as much as an enemy she can reach — otherwise a commander with no
## combat modifier at all banks a full meter while walking across an empty map.
## The ground is measured with the march's own movement, which is the point of it.
