## Meridian Coalition. Combined arms: her units hit harder when they fight
## alongside a different kind of unit, so her strength is a mixed, coordinated
## line rather than a stack of the same thing. Coordinated Push then moves that
## whole line at once.

## Percentage points added when a friendly of another movement class stands next
## to the firing unit.
