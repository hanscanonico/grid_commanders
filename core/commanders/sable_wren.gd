## Verdant League. Ambush doctrine: her army is worth more in cover than in the
## open, to the point of being punished for using roads. Vanish makes that cover
## absolute for a round.
##
## Vanish is the reworked version (decision D4). As originally written — "units
## in Woods can only be revealed from an adjacent tile" — it was a no-op, because
## Vision already hides *everyone's* woods units from non-adjacent viewers. So it
## became true invisibility: while the power runs her woods units are hidden even
## from an adjacent enemy, and the only thing that finds one is trying to move
## into its cell, which the movement rules already refuse.
##
## ROUND duration, unlike every other wave-2 power. An ambush that expired at the
## end of her own turn would never be there when the opponent walked into it.

## when an enemy can reach her line, not when she can reach one. It also needs
## somewhere to hide — with nobody in cover both halves of Vanish are no-ops, and
## a banked meter is worth more than a power that does nothing.
