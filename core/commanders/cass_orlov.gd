## Iron Dominion. A finisher: she is paid to close out wounded units, so her
## army trades best against a hurt one. No Escape widens the definition of
## "wounded" from nearly-dead to merely hurt, which is what turns a good turn
## into a rout.

## Enemies at or below this displayed HP are worth the passive bonus.
