## Aurora Compact. Precision: her damage rolls never come up short, so every
## attack lands where the forecast said it would, and she pays for that
## certainty with a thinner margin everywhere else. Perfect Solution removes the
## roll entirely for a turn.
##
## The only doctrine that touches luck. It narrows the range rather than
## replacing the roll, so exactly one number still comes off the seeded RNG per
## attack and a replay recorded on that seed stays in step.

## Negative on purpose: consistency is not free.
