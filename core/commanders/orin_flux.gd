## Aurora Compact. Intelligence: he sees further than anyone and, for a round,
## makes sure nobody else does. Signal Jam is the only power that reaches across
## the table, and it uses both halves of the power machinery — a one-shot strip
## of fuel and ammo, and an ongoing debuff that lasts until the jamming lifts.
##
## ROUND duration, so "enemy vision -1 until their next turn" means what it says:
## it has to still be running while the opponent plays.
