## What a team can see under fog of war. Every "can this player see X"
## question routes through here so the rules live in one place; with fog
## disabled the whole map is visible.
##
## Simplified Advance Wars rules:
## - Each unit on the board sees cells within its type's vision range
##   (Manhattan distance). Carried units see nothing.
## - Concealing terrain (woods, reefs) hides what stands on it: revealed only
##   from distance <= 1, regardless of the viewer's range.
## - Owned properties watch their surroundings out to PROPERTY_VISION.
##
## Commanders bend all three: a doctrine can lengthen a unit's sight, let it see
## into cover at range, jam an enemy's sight shorter, or hide its own units from
## a viewer who can otherwise see the cell they stand on. Because of that last
## one, seeing a *cell* and seeing the *unit* on it are now separate questions —
## see can_see_unit.

## Whether `viewer_team` can see `unit` at all — the question to ask before
## drawing or targeting an enemy, in place of looking its cell up directly.
##
## Usually that is exactly cell visibility, but a doctrine can hide a unit
## standing somewhere the viewer can otherwise see (Sable Wren's Vanish), so the
## two questions have to be asked separately. `visible` is the dictionary from
## visible_cells, passed in rather than recomputed because callers are drawing a
## whole board and already have it.

## Whether `unit` is hidden from `viewer_team` by something other than the fog
## itself: a doctrine (the invisibility half of Sable Wren's Vanish) or a dive.
##
## Split out from can_see_unit because it is the one visibility rule the AI
## respects: the planner sees the whole board deliberately, but a power that makes
## units unseeable — or a submarine that has gone under — would be inert against it
## otherwise, so it asks this instead of ignoring fog wholesale. Terrain, range and
## property sight stay invisible to that question.
##
## The two halves differ in one way worth being explicit about. Vanish is a fog
## power and does nothing in a clear match. A dive is not: a submerged sub is
## unseeable whether or not the match has fog, because being under the water is
## not a matter of how far anyone can see. Both are lifted by standing next to
## it — hunting a submarine means closing with it.
