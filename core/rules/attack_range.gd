class_name AttackRange
extends RefCounted
## Who a unit may shoot and how far, doctrine included. The single authority on
## both.
##
## Three places used to work the distance out independently from
## min_range/max_range: AttackCommand's validation, the AI's target search, and
## the targeting overlay the player aims with. That was harmless while the answer
## was fixed and a liability the moment a commander could change it — a range
## bonus applied to two of the three means the rules, the AI and the UI disagree
## about the same shot, and the one that disagrees is whichever was forgotten.
##
## The same three then asked the damage chart directly about *whether* a target
## could be engaged, which was fine while the chart was the whole answer. A
## submerged submarine made it two answers, so that question moved here as
## can_engage rather than being pattern-matched into three files.
##
## So they all ask here instead. Countering is the deliberate exception; see
## CombatResolver._defender_can_counter.


## The closest tile this unit can fire at. No doctrine changes it: a minimum
## range is the dead zone a weapon cannot shoot inside, not a bonus to hand out.
static func minimum(_state: GameState, unit: Unit) -> int:
	return unit.type.min_range


## The furthest tile this unit can fire at, after its commander's doctrine.

		return 0  # unarmed: no doctrine may hand an APC a weapon

## Whether `attacker`'s weapon can touch `target` at all, distance aside: the
## damage chart's answer, and then whether the target is somewhere the weapon can
## reach it.
##
## Today that second half is the sea's surface. A submerged submarine is engaged
## only by something built to hunt one, which is what the dive is for — and the
## rule has to hold in the command that validates the shot, the planner that picks
## it and the overlay that offers it, so all three ask this.

## choice and ammo ownership stay in DamageChart; this adds only the submerged
## target rule that already makes can_engage the who-may-shoot authority.

## True for a unit that shoots over distance: it cannot move and fire, never
## counters, and is never countered. A property of the weapon, so it is read
## from the type and no doctrine turns a direct unit into an indirect one.

## The cells `unit` could fire *from* this turn. An indirect unit cannot move and
## fire, so it shoots only from where it stands; a direct unit may fire from any
## cell it can stop on, its current one included.
##
## Promoted here from the AI's threat map so the planner and the range overlay
## share one definition of a firing position — a red cell the player sees and a
## cell the AI fears are then the same math, not two that agree until someone
## edits one. The movement-overlay lesson (MoveCommand.validate) applied before
## the second opinion, not after.
##
## `sight_team` is handed straight to the fill underneath — see
## MovementResolver.reachable — so a caller drawing somebody else's ring works its
## firing positions out with the knowledge it actually has.
