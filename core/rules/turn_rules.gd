## Start-of-turn bookkeeping for the current team: income, fuel upkeep, resupply,
## paid repairs on friendly properties, and readying units. Used by
## GameState.create for the first turn and by EndTurnCommand after.

const REPAIR_HP := 20  # internal HP (= 2 displayed) per turn on a property


## Every turn is charged the same, day one included. That is what keeps the two
## sides even: create() opens the match with this for the first team, and the
## second team gets its own call through EndTurnCommand before it acts, so both
## have paid exactly once by the time they move. Skipping the opening day would
## have charged the first player one fewer time over any equal count of turns.

## Fuel spent simply by existing, before anything refills it. Zero for ground
## units, which is why a tank parked in a field is the same unit it was in M2, and

## A transport refuels and re-ammoes every unit it carries, in full and wherever
## it stands — cargo is refilled by its transport, not beside it, so a rider that
## boarded on empty rides out full. Called only for a transport that survived its
## own upkeep, so cargo lost with a dry carrier is never touched; and cargo burns
## no upkeep of its own, so there is nothing to spend before this refill.

## An air or sea unit whose tank reached zero is destroyed here, and its cargo
## with it (remove_unit's rule, shared with every other death).
##
## The order in begin_turn is the whole mechanic and none of it is incidental:
## upkeep is charged *before* resupply, so a plane that never lands eventually
## falls; resupply runs before this check, so one that did land is always full
## again and can never die on friendly tarmac; and the check sits before repair
## because there is nothing left to mend. Nothing is banked to either Command
## Power meter — running yourself dry is not an exchange, and paying the other
## side charge for it would make starving your own air force a tactic.

## Whether the property `unit` stands on is one of ours *and* refits its domain.
## The single answer to that question: repair and resupply both ask it, so no
## property can ever refuel something it refuses to repair.
##
## `owner_at == unit.team`, deliberately not `allied` (four-players plan D2):
## allies share sight and purpose, never infrastructure. An ally's workshop does
## not repair your tanks, and the funds the repair is billed against are its own.

## A ROUND Command Power covers the opponent's turn and runs out the moment its
## owner's next one opens — here, before the turn it no longer applies to does
## anything. OWNER_TURN powers came down earlier, in EndTurnCommand.
