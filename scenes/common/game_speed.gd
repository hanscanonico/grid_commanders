class_name GameSpeed
extends RefCounted
## How fast the battle's theatre plays out on screen: one of four tiers, picked
## on the main menu and switchable mid-match.
##
## Presentation pacing and nothing else. No file under core/ or ai/ imports this
## or can reach a tier through Settings, so a speed change cannot move an
## outcome, a save, a replay or a seeded roll — the sim never observes the clock
## the theatre runs on. That is also why these numbers live here as constants
## rather than as .tres files under data/, breaking the difficulty-tier symmetry
## on purpose: data/ is for numbers the *sim* reads, and the whole safety
## argument of this setting is that the sim cannot read the speed.
##
## Which tier is active is Settings' answer and nobody else's. Callers ask it at
## the moment they animate rather than caching it at scene load, so a speed
## changed from the in-battle menu lands on the very next move.

## The tier a fresh install plays at: movement at twice the duration the game
## shipped with, which is the complaint this setting exists to fix. Quick is that
## original feel, one dropdown away.
const DEFAULT_ID := &"normal"
## Captures and scripted scenario runs pin this tier instead of reading the
## device preference: a screenshot must not depend on which machine took it.
##
## Instant, because a still frame has nothing to photograph in an animation and
## every second one runs for is a second `make smoke` spends waiting. Scenarios
## advance on the scene's own state machine rather than a frame count, which is
## what makes that safe — see BattleScenarioDriver._until_state. An explicit
## `--speed=` still wins, so a tier stays inspectable through a capture.
const CAPTURE_ID := &"instant"

## The durations the game shipped with, before any tier scaled them. Quick is
## these values exactly — which is what makes it "today's game, bit for bit".

const BASE_FLASH_IN_SECONDS := 0.08
const BASE_FLASH_OUT_SECONDS := 0.12

const BASE_COMMAND_DELAY_SECONDS := 0.2
## Banners are information, not theatre: they hold at a readable length whatever
## the tier and only tighten under Instant, because whose day it is must still
## register even when nothing else is being shown. The power banner holds longer
## than the day banner because its card opens with the general's spoken line
## (plan PQ1) — a sentence needs more of a beat than a title.
const BANNER_SECONDS := 1.2
const POWER_BANNER_SECONDS := 1.5
const INSTANT_BANNER_SECONDS := 0.5
## The AI opens its turn just after the awaited day banner clears. This is only
## the breathing room after it, never a second copy of the banner's own hold.
const START_DELAY_PADDING := 0.1

## Every tier, gentlest first — the order the menu lists and the in-battle row
## cycles in. `anim` scales movement, the hit flash and the death fade; `pace`
## scales the AI's think-beat between commands; `instant` skips the tweens
## outright instead of shortening them (an explicit branch, in the tradition of
## BattleAnimator's `capturing` flag, not a zero multiplied through the maths).
##
## This is the whole tuning surface: retuning a tier after playtest is one line.
