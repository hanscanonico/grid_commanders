class_name SideIdentity
extends RefCounted
## Resolves each side's presentation identity — theme colour, display name, and
## units/terrain atlas row — from the match's commander picks. One resolver,
## resolved once per match, read by every surface that used to say "Red"/"Blue"
## (Faction Identity plan D1/D2).
##
## Presentation only: the sim keeps its team ints everywhere, nothing here ever
## enters core/, and the identity is derived at scene setup and never stored — a
## resumed save re-resolves to the same answer because the commander picks are
## the same. The sim cannot disagree with the theatre about who is who because it
## never hears the question.
##
## No Node, no scene path: this sits in scenes/common/ beside CommanderVisuals,
## whose four faction themes it reads and never re-derives.

## Theme key -> the row the art pipeline draws that faction's units and property
## buildings at. MUST match tools/build_pixvoxel_atlases.sh ROW_NAMES and
## tools/generate_tiles.gd's row order: 0 neutral, 1 meridian(red),
## 2 aurora(blue), 3 iron, 4 verdant.

## The two original side colours — "classic" themes. Meridian is red, Aurora is
## blue. A commander-less side or a mirror side falls back to one of these; a
## faction side never does.
##
## Generic (commander-less) sides claim classics in this order, meridian then
## aurora, so a match with no commanders at all renders exactly as it did before
## factions: side 1 red, side 2 blue (plan D4).
const _GENERIC_ORDER: Array[StringName] = [&"meridian", &"aurora"]
## A mirror side — one whose faction an earlier slot already wears — borrows a
## classic in this order instead, aurora then meridian, taking the first that is
## hue-distinct from what is already on the board (plan D3). Iron v Iron ->
## slate + blue; Aurora v Aurora -> blue + red.
