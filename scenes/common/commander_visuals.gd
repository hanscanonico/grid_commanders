class_name CommanderVisuals
extends RefCounted
## Presentation adapter for commanders: turns the sim-side CommanderType (id,
## faction, text, numbers) into the things a scene needs to draw one — a portrait
## texture, a faction colour theme, an emblem — without any of that ever entering
## core/.
##
## This is the single authority on commander styling. The card, the battle HUD
## chip, and the power banner all ask here rather than each keeping their own
## copy of the four faction colours, exactly as the resolvers each own one rule.
## The offline portrait generator asks here too, so the art it bakes and the art
## the UI expects can never disagree about which colour a faction is.
##
## No Node, no scene path — but this is scenes/, not core/, so loading a
## Texture2D and caching it is allowed here where it would not be there.


## A faction's colour identity. Colour is always reinforced by the emblem and the
## faction name (see the plan's "faction first, never colour alone" principle),
## so nothing here is asked to carry meaning on hue alone.
