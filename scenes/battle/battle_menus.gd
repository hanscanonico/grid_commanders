class_name BattleMenus
extends RefCounted
## Which rows each of the battle scene's menus offers.
##
## Contents only. Battle still decides when a menu opens, where on screen it
## sits, and what choosing a row does; this decides what is on it. Split out of
## Battle for the same reason BattleView and BattleAnimator were — it is a
## separate job, and this one turns out to need nothing from the scene at all:
## every row below is gated by the command that would run it, or by the same
## terrain data that command validates against.
##
## That gating is the point rather than a convenience. A menu that worked out
## for itself whether a Load were legal would be a second opinion on the rules,
## and the day it disagreed with the command the player would be offered an
## action that is then refused. So each row asks the authority: Capture, Load and
## Join ask their commands, Supply asks SupplyCommand who is in reach, and
## production asks the terrain what it builds — exactly what BuildCommand checks.
##
## No scene tree and no sprite here, like the rest of the layers Battle delegates
## to. The one autoload it reads is Settings, for the speed row's label, and that
## is the same rule as everything above rather than an exception to it: whoever
## owns the answer is who gets asked.

## Rows for a unit whose move preview has finished on `dest` (the last cell of
## `path`). `can_fire` and `drop_options` are passed in because working them
## out needs the viewing team's fog, which is Battle's to know and not ours.
##
## Each droppable passenger gets its own row — a Lander can hold two and only one
## of them might fit the ground beside it — so a row names the unit it unloads and
## its id carries the option's index.

## Rows for the menu opened on empty ground: the turn-level actions. The HUD has
## a button for the Command Power, and this keeps it reachable from the keyboard
## too, which the rest of the game already is.
##
## The Speed row reads its label off Settings for the same reason every row above
## asks its command: the tier the player is watching at has one owner, and a menu
## that remembered its own copy would eventually show a speed the game is not
## playing at. Choosing it cycles to the next tier — see Battle's map handler.
##
## The two exit rows are the only way out of a running match that is not winning,
## losing or killing the application, so they are spelled out rather than folded
## into one: which of the two a player wants turns entirely on whether the single
## save slot may be overwritten, and a row that decided that quietly would be
## wrong for half of them either way.
##
## `commandable` is false when this opens over a turn that is not the player's —
## the pause they may take while the computer plays. The two rows that would *act*
## for the side on turn go with it; everything else stays, because the match, the
## device settings and the ways out are exactly what a pause is opened for.
##
## `savable` is false over a replay, and takes the two save rows with it. A
## recording is a match already played: there is no turn to come back to, and
## writing it would spend the single save slot on a board the player can only
## watch — resumed, it would come up as a hot-seat match nobody is sitting at,
## because a replay seats no computer.

## Rows for the second press "Main Menu Without Saving" asks for. Leaving is the
## one map-menu action nothing undoes — the board is gone, and the slot it walks
## past may hold a match days older than the one on screen — so it is the one that
## gets asked twice.
##
## A menu rather than a dialog of its own, which is what makes the confirmation
## reachable by every route the row that opened it was: ActionMenu already owns the
## keyboard, the mouse and the Esc that backs out, and already clamps itself inside
## the board band. The safe row leads deliberately — ActionMenu arms its first
## enabled row when it opens, so a confirmation that led with the abandon would put
## "throw the match away" under the Enter the player is already pressing — and it
## carries the plain `cancel` id, so the row, Esc and a click past it all mean the
## same thing.
