## The battle cut-in: when an attack resolves, the board gives way to a
## full-screen versus frame — attacker on the left, defender on the right, each
## posed over its own terrain — the volley crosses, HP ticks down, the counter
## comes back, and the map returns.
##
## It replays; it never decides (plan D1). Every beat below is driven by a field
## of the CombatResolver.CombatResult it is handed, including the two HP
## snapshots that exist for exactly this — by the time the cut-in runs, the
## command has applied and both units hold post-combat HP. Nothing here touches
## the damage chart, the RNG, or a rule.
##
## One clock, one exit. `_t` advances in `_process` and every visual is a pure
## function of it, so skipping is `_t = _total` rather than a race between
## cancelled tweens — the awaitable `play()` resolves exactly once, whatever the
## player presses (plan R2). The randomness in the shake is a function of `_t`
## too, so a posed frame is the same frame every run (R4).
##
## Owned by Battle, which assigns `view` and hands it to the animator — the same
## assignment-not-constructor shape BattleView and BattleAnimator use, so the
## cut-in never learns what a Battle is either.

## Emitted once per cut-in, when the wipe has cleared and control belongs to the
## caller again. Every branch funnels through `_finish`, which is the only place
## that emits it.
