class_name BattleAnimator
extends RefCounted
## Plays the battle scene's animations: unit movement, the combat exchange,
## the turn banner, camera shake, and the cursor pulse, with the sound effects
## that go with them.
##
## Every method here animates something that has *already* been decided. The
## animator never chooses a gameplay outcome, applies a command, or reads a
## rule — it is handed a result and shows it. Its awaitable methods let Battle
## hold the interaction flow still until an animation finishes.
##
## Depends on BattleView to find sprites; never on Battle. Tweens need a Node
## to live on, so the scene root is passed in as a plain Node.
##
## Every duration it waits is a GameSpeed tier's, asked of `Settings` at the
## moment the animation starts rather than cached at scene load, so a speed
## changed mid-match lands on the very next move. The sprite it hands durations
## to derives nothing, and BattleAiRunner paces its turn off the same answer. No
## literal seconds below: a tween timed by a number written here would ignore the
## player's setting forever.

## The two durations that deliberately do *not* follow the setting: the shake is
## impact feedback and the pulse is idle UI, and neither is gameplay theatre.
## Named rather than written inline so the exception is visibly meant, and so
## "no bare seconds in a battle tween" stays a grep anyone can run.
const SHAKE_STEP_SECONDS := 0.04
const CURSOR_PULSE_SECONDS := 0.4
## Two cut-ins closer together than this are treated as one run of fighting, and
## each one after the first is tightened (plan BA4, risk R1). Comfortably longer
## than BattleAiRunner.COMMAND_DELAY, which is what makes a computer's turn
## qualify; a human picks a unit, moves it and opens a menu between attacks, so
## an ordinary player's turn never does.
const CUT_IN_STREAK_GAP_MS := 1600
## How far the tightening goes: full ceremony at the start of a run, and by the
## fourth attack in a row a cut-in that plays a third faster with most of its
## closing hold gone. The volley and the impact keep their length throughout.

# --- movement ----------------------------------------------------------------

##
## Instant sets the destination and returns in the same frame — a path the flow
## already walks, since a one-cell "move" has always returned without a tween.

# --- combat ------------------------------------------------------------------


## Plays out one already-resolved exchange: the hit, the shake, whichever side
## died, and the counter. Awaitable, so the flow resumes once the dust settles.
##
## A null result means the move was ambushed short of the firing cell — the shot
## never happened — so there is nothing to play but the trap cue.
##
## Two bodies, one contract. With battle animations on, the exchange plays as the
## full-screen cut-in and the map is brought back into step underneath; with them
## off — or while capturing, when the viewer cannot see both combatants, or at the
## Instant tier where there is nothing to watch — the on-map version below runs,
## byte-for-byte as it always did. Either way this returns exactly once, which is
## what both call sites hold their flow on.
##
## Under Instant that on-map flash, fade and shake all fall away but the sounds
## stay: an attack the player triggered has to register even when there is
## nothing to see.

## a sprite outside combat entirely and comes through here for that reason.

## Whether this exchange gets the cut-in.
##
## The visibility half is the point of the gate: under fog an exchange the
## viewer cannot see would otherwise parade two hidden units across the screen,
## so it stays on the map path, which already draws fogged units correctly. The
## question goes to the view, which asks `Vision` — no second opinion on who can
## see what lives here (plan R6).
##
## Instant is out too: that tier exists to skip the theatre, so a full-screen
## cut-in playing on its own clock would defeat it — the exchange stays on the
## map path, which under Instant collapses to just the sounds.

## Sets how much ceremony whichever cut-in is about to play gets, from how long
## it has been since the last one (plan BA4). Two seconds a battle is charming for
## ten battles and a chore for two hundred — R1, the plan's own named risk — and a
## computer turn that opens fire or captures five times is exactly where that
## bites. So a run of cut-ins tightens as it goes: faster overall, and most of the
## closing hold cut away. Combat and capture share the one streak counter, so a
## turn mixing attacks and captures tightens as a single run; the pacing is routed
## to both cutscenes and whichever one is about to play reads it.
##
## What is *not* touched is the volley, the impact and the HP tick. Those carry
## the information; trimming them would make the cut-in shorter and worse, which
## is the wrong trade at any speed.

## A short zoom onto the cell about to be struck, so the board flinches before
## the frame is taken away from it. Awaited, then left punched in: the cut-in
## covers the map for its whole run and, handed the camera and this resting zoom,
## eases it home over the closing wipe so the board is already at rest the moment
## it is uncovered — see CombatCutscene._restore_zoom.

## The map beats the cut-in stands in for. Both sides have already been shown
## dying on screen, so there is no fade left to play: this only brings the board
## back into step with a sim that has moved on — dropping the sprites of units
## the exchange removed (cargo that went down with a transport included) and
## redrawing the survivors.
func _sync_aftermath() -> void:
	view.sync_sprites()


# --- capture -----------------------------------------------------------------


## Plays out one already-applied capture: the march, the mashes, and — on a
## completing capture — the flip to the capturer's colours. Awaitable, so the
## flow resumes once the banner has cleared. The sibling of `animate_combat`, and
## it obeys the same gate, the same streak pacing, and the same camera contract.
##
## A null result means the move was ambushed short of the property — nothing was
## captured, and the `settle_move` both call sites run afterwards plays the trap
## cue — so there is nothing here to replay.
##
## With the cut-in gated out — animations off, while capturing, at the Instant
## tier, or when the viewer cannot see the capturer — the map path is a single
## `capture` thump if the cell is visible, and nothing else: the board repaint
## the caller runs after this is what shows the result, byte-for-byte as it did
## before the cut-in existed. Either way this returns exactly once.
func animate_capture(result: CaptureCommand.CaptureResult, unit: Unit, cell: Vector2i) -> void:

## Whether this capture gets the cut-in. The same four questions as the combat
## gate, with one unit instead of two: the capturer stands on the very cell it
## takes, so a single visibility check answers for the whole scene (plan R6). No
## second opinion on who can see what lives here — the view asks `Vision`.

# --- ambush ------------------------------------------------------------------


## The cue when a committed move runs into a hidden enemy and stops short: put the
## mover's sprite back where the sim actually left it — the preview walked it
## further — and name the trap. Shared by every move-family action, combat too,
## where the shot simply never fires.
func show_ambush(unit: Unit) -> void:
	view.refresh_sprite(unit)

## Brings a moved unit's sprite back in step with the sim after an ordinary
## (non-combat) action, springing the ambush cue in place of a plain refresh when
## the move was cut short. Every such action funnels its sprite update here so the
## trap reads the same however the move was going to end.
func settle_move(command: Command, unit: Unit) -> void:
	if command.ambushed:
		show_ambush(unit)
	else:
		view.refresh_sprite(unit)


## The sprite side of a Join: the moving unit's twin fades away and the survivor
## redraws where they merged — unless a hidden enemy stopped the move short, in
## which case nobody merged and the mover is simply back on its own cell.

## The Command Power activation card: portrait, the general's spoken line, power
## name, and exact effect text, faction-tinted. Shown when a power fires (player
## or AI, both through Battle's _announce_power) and auto-hidden after a beat.
## `team` keys the card's quote rotation, so the two sides speak independently.
## While capturing it holds, so a screenshot of the same activation is the same
## frame — the whole reason the two open-ended animations above are suppressed
## for captures.
func show_power_banner(commander: CommanderType, team: int) -> void:

# --- camera and cursor -------------------------------------------------------


## Brief camera jitter on combat hits. Presentation-only randomness: this
## must never touch game.rng, which is reserved for deterministic sim luck.
##
## Skipped while capturing: the shake is still mid-tween when a frame is taken,
## so it offsets the whole board by a few pixels and makes two otherwise
## identical captures differ everywhere — noise that would hide a real
## rendering regression.
##
## Skipped under Instant too, which is the one tier where it is theatre rather
## than feedback: there is no hit animation left for it to punctuate.
##
## Tweened through `BattleView.shake_offset`, never `camera.offset` directly. The
## view uses that property to dock the board in the band between the two HUD
## bars, so a shake written straight to the camera would settle at Vector2.ZERO
## and leave the board half a bar low for the rest of the match. The view
## composes the two; the shake only ever says how far it is jittering.

## Skipped while capturing, for the same reason as `shake_camera`: a loop has
## no settled state, so every frame catches it at a different phase.
