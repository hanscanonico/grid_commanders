extends RefCounted
## Owns how a match ends: the victory lockup, fronting it with the winning
## commander, and — for a `make balance-watch` run — the day cap that stops a
## watched replay and the one line the fidelity check diffs.
##
## Split out of Battle the same way BattleView, BattleAnimator, BattleAiRunner and
## BattleScenarioDriver were: it drives Battle's own state machine and scene nodes
## rather than deciding anything itself. The board decides who won; a watched match
## stopped by the day cap is scored on the harness's own tiebreak, not here. Battle
## holds one for the whole scene and calls `enter_victory`/`end_watch_on_day_cap`
## at the same points it used to call the private methods these were.
##
## Holds the scene like BattleAiRunner (it sets Battle.state and needs get_tree()),
## and is handed the victory screen's own nodes at build time like BattleAnimator's
## banner nodes — this reporter draws on them and nothing else does.

## Buffered cut-in presses die here before either outcome action can own them.
## Fixed rather than tier-scaled: this is an input safety window, not theatre.
