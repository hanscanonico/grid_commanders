class_name BattleZoom
extends RefCounted
## Owns the battle camera's zoom: the current level, its clamp against the view's
## minimum, and the zoom steps themselves. Battle decides when to zoom and the view
## owns the camera itself — this sits between them, split out of battle.gd so the
## interaction flow could shed a responsibility (the gdlintrc line ratchet).
##
## Semantics are unchanged from when this lived in Battle: the floor is the view's
## min_zoom ceil'd to two decimals, the ceiling is MAX_ZOOM, and each press steps
## the level by STEP.
