class_name BattleAiRunner
extends RefCounted
## Plays a full computer turn: plan one command, animate it, repeat until the AI
## ends its turn or the per-turn safety cap trips.
##
## Split out of Battle the same way BattleView, BattleAnimator and
## BattleScenarioDriver were — it is the AI's side of the interaction flow, and
## like the scenario driver it drives Battle's own entry points (the same
## animations, the same turn hand-off, the same victory check) rather than
## reaching past them, so an AI turn resolves and animates exactly as a player's
## does. Battle holds one of these for the whole scene and calls `run()` when a
## computer team's turn opens.

## Safety net: a planner bug can never hang the match, only force a turn to end.
## Read from the harness rather than declared here, because the headless engine
## applies the identical cut (balance plan D7) — if the two drifted apart, a
## watched match could be trimmed where its headless row was let run, and the
## replay-fidelity check would fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the
## sim.

## than a slideshow. Paced off Settings, the same tier the animations it sits
## between run at — a computer turn and a player's move obey one setting.
##
## Instant drops the wait to a single frame rather than to nothing: the board
## still repaints once per command, so a forty-command turn is forty frames the
## eye can track as a fast flicker, the window keeps pumping events, and the
## per-turn safety cap above keeps meaning what it says.

## Applies one AI command with the same animations the player flow uses.
## Attack/Capture are checked before Move because each is its own Command
## subclass. The cursor and camera follow so the player can watch — but only for an
## action the viewer can actually see (`_can_watch`). A computer move made entirely
## inside the viewer's fog is applied without moving the cursor, panning the camera
## or sounding its footsteps, so a fogged turn no longer broadcasts every hidden
## step; the mover's sprite stays hidden and lands on its committed cell without a
## tween.
##
## The move-family branches (Attack, Capture, Dive, Move) apply the command first,
## then tween only the path actually walked — an ambush by a hidden enemy cut it
## short of the plan — and land the sprite through `BattleAnimator.settle_move`, the
## same seam the player flow uses, so a watched ambush springs the same "Ambush!"
## banner and a fogged one places the sprite in silence. An attack that reached its
## firing cell hands off to `animate_combat` for the shot instead.
