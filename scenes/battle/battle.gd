class_name Battle
extends Node2D
## Battle scene root: renders map + units, drives cursor/camera, and runs the
## interaction flow — selection, movement, menus, targeting, transport, AI
## turns, and victory. All rules live in core/; this scene only issues commands
## and animates the results.
##
## `confirm_at`, `set_cursor_cell`, and `leave_handoff` are public because they
## are the entry points player input arrives at, and BattleScenarioDriver
## stands in for a player through exactly those.
##
## `start_turn`, `announce_power`, `enter_victory`, `refresh_fog`, `refresh_hud`
## and `refresh_panel` are public for the same reason one step further out:
## BattleAiRunner plays a computer turn through the flow a human's commands run,
## so it needs those steps by name. They are the whole extra surface — a
## collaborator that wants anything else wants a new entry point here, not a
## reach into a private method.
