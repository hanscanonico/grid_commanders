extends GutTest
## The three Difficult-tier planner capabilities (plan DF3), each on a crafted
## state, each proved by the same board reaching a different command with the
## capability on than with it off.
##
## Almost every test builds its own profile rather than leaning on
## data/ai/hard.tres: these pin the *behaviour* of each smart, so retuning a
## shipped weight is a balance decision and never a test failure.
##
## The exception is deliberate. A capability suite where every test picks its own
## weight cannot notice a tier that ships a weight too small to do anything —
## which is exactly how Difficult shipped a kill-zone refusal that never refused
## anything. So one test loads the real Difficult profile and asserts the shipped
## configuration reaches the behaviour the tier claims.

# --- S1 · threat awareness ----------------------------------------------------


## The flagship case. A tank walking at an enemy artillery ends its advance on
## the closest cell it can reach — which is inside the artillery's firing ring.
## With threat awareness on it gives up one tile and stops outside the ring.
##
## Exercised at 2.0, the value data/ai/hard.tres ships, because that is the
## claim: this dial is denominated in tiles precisely so a ladder-safe weight can
## still move a unit. The arithmetic is tight and worth spelling out — the shot
## forecasts 63 damage, so a tile costs 63/100 of the dial, and anything under
## ~1.6 leaves the tank inside the ring however confident the docs sound.
