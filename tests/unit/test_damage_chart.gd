## Lint over data/damage_chart.tres, because every way that file goes wrong is
## silent. A missing entry across both weapon tables *is* the rule "this attacker
## cannot damage that defender" (DamageChart.base_damage returns -1), so a typo'd
## id, a forgotten row or a whole missing column produces a matchup that simply
## never happens — no error, no crash, nothing in the log. The only place that
## can be caught is here.
##
## What each test asserts is deliberately structural rather than numerical:
## balance lives in the numbers and moves with playtesting, but "an anti-air gun
## can shoot at aircraft" is not a balance question, and neither is "every id in
## the chart is a unit that exists".
