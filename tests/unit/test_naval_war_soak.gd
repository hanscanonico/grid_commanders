extends GutTest
## AI vs AI on the naval board, played long enough that fleets are built and meet.
##
## It is also the suite's mixed-domain soak, because The Straits has a base, an
## airport *and* a port on each side: an army, an air force and a fleet all
## planned by the same planner against each other, which is the only place the
## three domains' rules meet outside the balance runner.
##
## The sibling of test_air_war_soak.gd, and there for the same reason: naval rules
## live in more than one layer each — passability in terrain data and in
## MovementResolver's fill and in MoveCommand's re-validation of the path it
## produced; production in TerrainType.builds and BuildCommand and the planner;
## refit in TurnRules. When two of those drift the symptom is not a wrong number
## but a planner proposing a command the rules refuse, and no single-layer test
## sees it.
##
## It also guards the map's own premise. The Straits is built so that two fleets
## can actually reach each other — the strait is one body of water, and the land
## wraps around both ends rather than being joined by a bridge that would cut it
## in half. That is a property of the board, not of the code, so it is checked
## here: if an edit to the map severs the channel, the fleets stop meeting and
## this notices.
