## The submarine's dive: the one mechanic that touches movement, targeting,
## vision and the save format at once.
##
## Each of those is a place the rule could be half-implemented and look fine. A
## dived boat that is still targetable is a sub with an expensive downside and no
## upside; one that is hidden but still counterattacks gives itself away for free;
## one that saves and reloads on the surface loses a match's worth of position.
## So each is asserted separately here rather than trusted to the one flag they
## all read.
