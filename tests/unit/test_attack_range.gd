## AttackRange.threat_cells — the geometry the range overlay paints and the AI's
## ThreatMap is built from. One authority, so a red cell the player sees and a
## cell the planner fears are the same math. These pin the shape: a direct unit's
## reach is its move area grown by its range, an indirect unit's is a ring pinned
## to where it stands, and a friendly blocker deletes a firing cell and its fringe.
