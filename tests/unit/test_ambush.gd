## Fog ambush: a unit plans its move with only what its side can see, so an enemy
## it cannot see — fogged, or a dived sub it is not standing next to — is planned
## through as if the cell were empty. The trap springs on commit: GameState
## .advance_unit cuts the move short at the last free cell before the hidden unit,
## still spends the turn, and any follow-on bound to the move (attack, capture, …)
## is dropped. No RNG anywhere: the whole mechanic is deterministic.
