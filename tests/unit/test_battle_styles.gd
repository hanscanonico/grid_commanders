## Every unit names a weapon signature that exists, and the ones that cannot
## shoot name one that fires nothing.
##
## In scope despite living beside the cut-in: BattleStyle is a Resource and
## BattleStyleDB is a RefCounted, both Node-free, and what is under test is data
## integrity — a `.tres` naming a style that is not there — not how anything
## looks. The same reason tests/unit/test_maps.gd parses every shipped board.
##
## Worth pinning because the failure is quiet. A misspelled key does not crash:
## BattleStyleDB deliberately degrades to unarmed, so the unit simply stops
## firing anything in the cut-in and the exchange still resolves correctly. That
## is the right behaviour in play and exactly the wrong behaviour to discover in
## play.
