## The single exception to the AI's omniscience: a unit a doctrine has hidden.
##
## The planner sees the whole board on purpose — an openly-cheating opponent
## rather than a guessing one — and that stays true for terrain, range and
## property sight. Sable Wren's Vanish is the one visibility rule that is a
## *power* rather than a fact about the map, and an invisibility power that the
## computer opponent ignores is inert in the only match most people play. So the
## planner asks Vision.is_hidden_from, and nothing else.
