extends GutTest
## Plays every commander against another one, AI on both sides, and asserts that
## nothing the planner proposes is ever rejected by the rules.
##
## This exists because it caught a bug that 277 unit tests did not. Every hook
## added over C1-C4 has a call site in the resolvers *and* a second one in
## command validation, and testing a doctrine in isolation proves the first
## without touching the second. MoveCommand worked the movement budget out from
## unit.type.move_points itself, so every commander who granted movement made
## the flood fill offer cells the command then refused — the AI stalled on a
## rejected command, and a player under Coordinated Push would have seen a range
## they could not actually use.
##
## The general shape is the point: a planner proposing an illegal command means
## two places disagree about a rule. Nothing here checks *which* rule, so it
## keeps working as doctrines are added.

## Enough turns for both sides to bank a meter and fire powers repeatedly —
## the interesting window, since a power is when the rules change mid-turn.

## A fixture rather than a shipped map, because the per-commander assertion
## below needs every gate to be *openable* from the starting position instead of
## by luck of the advance heuristic:
##
## - contested cities inside an infantry's first move, for Popular Uprising and
##   Ghost March, which wait on ground rather than on a fight;
## - woods under a starting unit on each side, because Vanish does nothing with
##   nobody in cover and so refuses to fire — on crossfire.txt no unit starts on
##   woods, which left Sable Wren passing only if the AI happened to route a
##   unit through an F tile;
## - both armies inside each other's reach on day one, which is what opens the
##   offensive gates, banks meters through trading, and wears units down far
##   enough for Open the Depots.
##
## 180-degree rotationally symmetric, (x, y) -> (11 - x, 8 - y), so neither side
## gets a terrain or income edge.
