extends GutTest
## AI vs AI on the air board, played long enough that aircraft actually arrive.
##
## The unit tests around it each check one rule in one place. This is the test
## that checks they agree: air movement lives in terrain data, production in
## TerrainType.builds *and* BuildCommand.validate *and* the planner, refit and the
## crash in TurnRules, targeting in the damage chart. Every one of those is read
## from more than one layer, and the failure mode when two of them drift is not a
## wrong number — it is the planner proposing a command the rules then refuse,
## which no single-layer test can see. That is precisely the bug an earlier soak
## caught after 277 unit tests missed it.
##
## test_map_soak.gd plays every board for ten days, which proves each is
## navigable but ends before anyone can afford a 20 000 airframe. This one plays
## the one board built for aircraft, for long enough that they fly.
##
## What it deliberately does *not* assert is anything about the route a plane
## takes. Whether the AI happens to fly one over a mountain in a given match is
## emergent, and a gate that depends on it fails for reasons that have nothing to
## do with what it guards. That air units cross ground others cannot is a rule,
## so it is pinned as one, deterministically, in test_movement_resolver.gd.

## Long enough for four properties of income to buy airframes and for those to
## reach the far side and start running low. Roughly twice the general soak.
