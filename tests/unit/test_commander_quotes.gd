## Every general that has a Command Power ships the spoken lines the activation
## banner reads (power-quotes plan PQ1), and every line fits the card.
##
## In scope for the same reason test_battle_styles.gd is: power_quotes is
## presentation data in the battle_style tradition — a display field on a
## Node-free Resource that no rule reads — and what is under test is data
## integrity, not how anything looks. The failure is quiet: the banner
## deliberately degrades to the quote-less card, which is the right behaviour
## in play and exactly the wrong behaviour to discover in play.

## The editorial ruler, not a rendering fact: the banner wraps at a fixed width,
## so what the cap really guards is each line staying a spoken beat rather than
## a paragraph. Raising it is a writing decision, not a fix.
