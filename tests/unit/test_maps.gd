## Playability lint over every map in maps/ — including maps added after this
## file was written, since it discovers the roster through MapCatalog instead of
## listing it.
##
## MapData.parse and GameState.create already reject *malformed* maps: ragged
## rows, unknown terrain or unit symbols, owners on non-property cells,
## out-of-bounds entries, two units on one cell, a unit standing on terrain it
## cannot enter. What neither catches is a map that loads perfectly and is then
## unplayable — and each assertion below is one of those:
##
## - A third, neutral HQ is a free win button: CaptureCommand sets `winner` on
##   *any* HQ, no matter who owned it.
## - A side with no base has no income engine and an AI that can never build.
## - A team-3 owner or unit parses today and then silently never plays, because
##   next_team() cycles GameState.TEAMS.
## - HQs walled off from each other make the HQ-capture win unreachable, which
##   quietly reduces the match to rout-only.
## - A map whose header claims symmetry and does not have it hands one side a
##   terrain or income edge that no amount of playtesting attributes correctly.
## - A port with no sailable water beside it builds hulls that can never leave
##   the dock, and two ports on separate bodies of water build two fleets that
##   can never meet — the naval plan's R1, which the AI cannot plan its way out
##   of because it cannot ferry.
## - A shoal is road that also floats: identical cost for every land class, plus
##   lander access. That makes a careless one a bridge, and a bridge across water
##   silently deletes whatever the water was there to separate.
##
## Every failure names the map it failed on. "The roster is broken" is not an
## actionable failure message.
