## Fuel upkeep and the crash: the rule that separates aircraft from faster tanks.
## They burn fuel simply by existing and are destroyed when the tank runs dry, so
## holding an airfield is what keeps an air force in the sky.
##
## The order inside TurnRules.begin_turn is the whole mechanic — upkeep, then
## resupply, then the empty-tank check, then repair — so each step of it is
## pinned separately here. Movement fuel, ammo and field supply live next door in
## test_fuel_and_ammo.gd; this file is only what upkeep added.
