## The opening begin_turn — day 1 for the first player, run inside GameState.create
## — must resolve against that side's real commander, not the neutral one. The bug:
## every caller assigned commanders *after* create, so team 1's day-1 doctrine
## (Gideon Holt's two-tile supply radius) went unconsulted, while team 2's first
## turn, reached later through EndTurnCommand, already saw its real commander.
## Passing commanders into create closes that slot-order asymmetry.

# A b_copter burns two fuel every begin_turn, so its opening tick is observable
# even on day 1 when every unit starts full: an APC two tiles away tops it back up
# under Gideon's radius, but only an adjacent one would under the neutral radius
# of 1. Both sides carry an APC-and-copter pair so either slot can be tested.
