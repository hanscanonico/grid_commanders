## AI vs AI on every shipped map: the proof that a board is *playable*, not
## merely parseable.
##
## test_commander_match_soak.gd established the shape and why it pays — an
## AI-vs-AI match is the one test that runs the planner, the resolvers and
## command validation against each other, and it caught a movement bug that 277
## unit tests missed. That file varies the commander over a fixed fixture map;
## this one holds the commanders neutral and varies the map, so the board is the
## only thing under test.
##
## It is the dynamic half of a question test_maps.gd answers statically. The
## lint catches an HQ walled off behind sea by reading the grid. This catches
## the version no static check sees: a board the AI can cross on paper and then
## does nothing on.

## Long enough for both sides to bank income, build, and meet in the middle on
## the largest board, without making the suite pay for a full match per map.
const DAYS := 10
## Commands one turn can plausibly need, per map cell. A stall shows up as a
## planner that keeps proposing without the day ever ending, so the cap only has
## to be above "a real match" — it is a deadlock detector, not a budget.
