class_name ThreatMap
extends RefCounted
## Where the enemy could hit next turn, and how hard. For every enemy that can
## reach a firing position and shoot a given board cell, this records that the
## cell is threatened by that unit; a caller then asks "if my unit stood here,
## what damage answers it?" and gets a luck-free forecast summed over those
## enemies. This is the one thing Difficult weighs that Normal and Easy do not:
## it lets a unit refuse to end its move in a kill zone.
##
## Node-free like the rest of ai/. Reuses the single authorities and re-derives
## no rules: MovementResolver for each enemy's reach, AttackRange for its firing
## ring and for whether an enemy may engage the defender at all (can_engage, so a
## dived sub is charged nothing by a hunter that cannot reach under the water),
## CombatResolver.forecast_at for the damage. Forecast is luck-free and draws no
## RNG, so a Difficult match stays as deterministic and replayable as any other
## tier.
##
## The expensive half — one flood fill per enemy — depends only on where the
## enemies are, which does not change during the side's own turn (a unit only
## leaves the board by dying to a counter). So AIPlanningContext builds one of
## these once per turn and reuses it across every command planned that turn,
## keyed on the day and the enemy set so a new day always rebuilds it — the day
## marks the turn boundary because a controller plans for one team for the whole
## match and its team id never changes.
##
## One approximation comes with that, and it is deliberate: an enemy's reach is
## flood-filled against the board as it stood when the map was built, so our own
## units moving during the turn does not re-open or re-block the lanes they were
## standing in. Refreshing per command would cost a fill per enemy per command
## for a second-order correction. The map is a scoring heuristic and never a
## legality check, so the cost of being slightly stale is a slightly wrong
## preference, never an illegal move.

## cell -> Array[Unit]: the enemies that can bring `cell` under fire. An enemy
## appears at most once per cell however many firing positions reach it.
var _by_cell: Dictionary = {}


## Builds the map for `team` from the enemies it can see. The caller passes the
## visible-enemy list (already filtered through Vision) so this stays ignorant of
## the fog rules — it never widens what the AI is allowed to know.
static func build(state: GameState, enemies: Array[Unit]) -> ThreatMap:

			map._mark_ring(state, enemy, from, low, high)
	return map


## Flags every in-bounds cell in the [low, high] firing ring around `from` as
## threatened by `enemy`. The ring geometry — which cells, in what order — is
## AttackRange's, the same walk threat_cells and the range overlay use; this only
## records who threatens each one, the attribution the union throws away.

## Expected luck-free damage `defender` would take standing on `cell`, summed
## over every enemy that threatens it and capped at the defender's HP — two
## attackers cannot cost more than the unit is worth.
##
## Evaluates the shot with the defender *at* `cell`, which is the whole point:
## the terrain it would move onto changes how hard it is hit. `forecast_at`
## takes that position as an effective value, so scoring a hypothetical move
## asks a question without ever standing the unit somewhere to ask it. The
## enemy's firing cell does not affect outgoing damage (only the defender's
## terrain does), so any in-range origin gives the same number and the stored
## per-cell list is enough.
