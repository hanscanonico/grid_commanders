extends RefCounted
## Plans commands for an AI-controlled team, one command per call. Pure
## simulation logic with no Node dependencies: the battle scene applies and
## animates whatever this returns, exactly like player input would.
## An EndTurnCommand means the AI is done with its turn.
##
## Deliberately "credible, not strong": greedy per-unit utility scoring with
## no lookahead. Deterministic for a given state (ties break by scan order),
## so replays and tests stay stable.
##
## Every number it weighs lives in an AIProfile resource rather than in this
## file, so tuning and difficulty are data edits. This class decides *how* to
## choose; the profile decides *what it is worth*.

## S3. Orders every combat unit by how well it answers the enemy's actual,
## cost-weighted roster, blended with the static build_priority order by
## build_reactivity. At reactivity 0 this returns nothing (the static list runs
## instead); at 1 the matchup decides outright. Both components are normalised to
## 0..1 so the blend mixes like with like. Only the *order* changes — whatever
## comes out is built by the same BuildCommand as any other buy.
##
## Empty when there is nothing to react to — no roster in sight, or none of it
## takable damage — and the static list decides instead. Without that, full
## reactivity would score every candidate at zero and buy whichever the database
## happened to list first.
##
## Scored across the whole roster rather than only what this turn's purse and
## this facility can produce, because a rank has to mean the same thing at every
## facility and under _worth_waiting_for's larger hypothetical budget. Producing
## the winner is still TerrainType.builds' call: _pick_build filters before it
## ever compares ranks, so a counter-build can never name a hull a base cannot
## lay down.
