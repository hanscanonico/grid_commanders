class_name BalanceReportWriter
extends RefCounted
## Writes a balance run's artifacts: CSV tables, a JSON summary, and the
## per-command JSONL log.
##
## Shared by the commander matrix, the difficulty ladder and the Balance Lab so
## the three write the same shapes — and, for the two committed gates, the same
## bytes they always did. The CSV format is deliberately the plainest thing that
## a spreadsheet opens: comma-separated, one header line, LF endings, trailing
## newline. Nothing here quotes, because nothing written through it contains a
## comma; the tally fields that could are semicolon-separated at the source.
##
## Node-free, like the rest of the harness.


## Absolutizes an out-directory given relative to the project root, creating it.
## A `res://`-spelled path is the same directory said the other way, so it is
## normalised rather than joined: `path_join` concatenates, and a caller that
## reads its input through `res://` and writes it raw would land the artifact in
## a literal `res:` directory at the project root while believing it wrote where
## it was told.

## One compact JSON object per line. Written in one store rather than a line at a

## charges per call, not per byte.
