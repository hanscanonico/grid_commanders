class_name BalanceMatchEngine
extends RefCounted
## Plays one headless AI-vs-AI match to a decision, a day cap, or a command cap,
## with an independent planner per side and an optional telemetry recorder.
##
## This is the loop the whole offline toolchain shares: the commander matrix, the
## difficulty ladder and the Balance Lab all run *this*, so a number one of them
## reports means the same thing in the other two. Extracting it is plan D1, and
## the merge bar for the extraction is a fixed-seed byte-diff of the two shipped
## gates' reports — see docs/balance_sim.md.
##
## It calls the same AIController and the same Command objects play does, so a
## match here resolves exactly as one in the battle scene given the same seed.
## Nothing here reads the clock or an unseeded RNG except the planning timer,
## whose output is reported and never fed back into the sim.
##
## Node-free, like core/ and ai/, so GUT drives it directly.

## Match-level safety net: a match that cannot resolve is a bug, and this stops
## the batch rather than the batch stopping the machine. Reaching it is a hard
## failure of a run, never a draw.
const COMMAND_CAP := 3000
## Per-turn safety net, and the one number the harness and the battle scene must
## agree on (plan D7). The scene has always force-ended a turn that ran this long
## so a planner bug could not hang the window; the harness applies the identical
## cut, so a watched match can never be trimmed where its headless row was let
## run. BattleAiRunner reads it from here for that reason — one owner, no drift.
const MAX_COMMANDS_PER_TURN := 300

## Everything one match needs. Built by the caller so each side's profile stays
## the caller's choice. The engine requires a distinct AIController per team,
## matching live play: controller caches and future planner state belong to one
## side and never cross the turn boundary.
