## Turns a Balance Lab run's raw rows into the judgement in summary.json: which
## swept value looks unbalanced, how much the first seat is worth on each board,
## and how much of either number to believe.
##
## It computes **nothing the CSVs do not already say** — every figure here is an
## aggregate of matches.csv and timeline.csv, which is what lets the HTML report
## be checked against the raw files by hand.
##
## Node-free, so GUT can drive it.

## The standing bands, identical to docs/commander_balance.md's, so a Balance Lab
## number is read against the same thresholds the committed record uses.
