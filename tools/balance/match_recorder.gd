class_name BalanceMatchRecorder
extends RefCounted
## Turn-by-turn telemetry for a Balance Lab match, and the optional per-command
## log beside it.
##
## It **observes** (plan D2). Nothing under core/ or ai/ gained a signal, a hook
## or a field for it: the recorder is handed each command just before and just
## after `apply()` — which the harness already brokers — and reads public
## GameState. What the Lab measures is therefore bit-for-bit the shipped game,
## and the tool cannot bend the game toward being measurable.
##
## Node-free on purpose, so GUT drives it directly (plan §8).
##
## ## Grain
##
## One row per **played turn**: match x day x side. A row covers everything from
## that side's start-of-turn tick to its own EndTurnCommand, so every event in
## the match lands in exactly one row. The tick is the seam that matters — a
## side's income, its paid repairs and any unit that dies with a dry tank all
## happen inside the *previous* side's EndTurnCommand.apply(), and they belong to
## the incoming side's row, which is why the row is opened in `after_apply` of
## that command rather than before it.
##
## The one exception is that seam's own edge: a match can end on the tick that
## opens a turn nobody then plays — the day cap falls, or the tick strands a
## side's last aircraft and routs it. Such a row is filed anyway *when it carries
## a unit leaving the board*, because the death is real and the census has to see
## it; an otherwise empty one is dropped. See `end_match`.
##
## ## Attribution (plan D3)
##
## A unit leaving the board is not always a death. Removals are diffed against a
## live set and then classified by *the command that caused them*:
##
##   - AttackCommand  — the target dying, or the attacker dying to counter-fire;
##                      cargo goes down with its transport either way
##   - EndTurnCommand — an air or sea unit whose tank ran dry in the start-of-turn
##                      tick (Orin Flux's jam can cause this a turn later)
##   - CaptureCommand — an HQ taken eliminates its owner (four-players plan D3),
##                      which sweeps that army's whole remaining force off the
##                      board. Nothing was shot, so those units are `forfeited`:
##                      counting them as kills would credit the capturer with
##                      destroying an army at full cost that it never fought
##   - JoinCommand    — the mover merges into its twin: it left the board and
##                      nothing died, so it is counted apart from both kills and
##                      losses and the reconciliation still closes
##   - LoadCommand    — not a removal at all: a passenger keeps its place in
##                      `state.units` with `carrier` set, which is precisely why
##                      diffing the *unit list* is honest where diffing
##                      `unit_at()` would not be
##
## Anything else that removes a unit lands in `unattributed`, which
## `reconcile()` gates on — a miscount is a red build, not a quiet lie in the
## data.
