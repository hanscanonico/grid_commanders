class_name BalanceSideSpec
extends RefCounted
## One side of a Balance Lab matchup: `<commander>:<tier>` — a commander id (or
## `none`) and a difficulty tier, which is the whole description of a seat.
##
## The grammar lives here rather than in either caller because both need it and
## they must agree: the headless Lab scores a matchup, and the battle scene
## boots the *same* matchup for watch mode. A spec parsed two ways is a spec
## that eventually disagrees, and the replay-fidelity check would be measuring
## the parser instead of the sim.
##
## Node-free, like everything else the sim leans on, so GUT can drive it.

## What a side is when the flag is omitted: no doctrine, the shipped planner.
const DEFAULT_TEXT := "none:normal"

var commander: StringName = CommanderType.NEUTRAL_ID
var tier: StringName = Difficulty.DEFAULT_ID
## Empty when the spec parsed cleanly; otherwise why it did not.
var error: String = ""


## Parses `<commander>:<tier>`. Either half may be omitted (`gideon_holt`,
## `:hard`, or the empty string), and the missing one takes its default.
##
## Ids are checked against the databases rather than accepted on faith: a
## mistyped commander would otherwise silently become neutral through
## CommanderDB's forgiving lookup and the run would measure the wrong matchup.
