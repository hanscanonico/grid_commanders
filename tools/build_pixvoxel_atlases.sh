# Composes the battle scene's unit art and property-building art from the CC0
# PixVoxel "Revised Wargame Sprites" pack by Tommy Ettinger.
#
#   source: https://opengameart.org/content/pixvoxel-revised-isometric-wargame-sprites
#   pack:   Revised_PixVoxel_Wargame_1.7z  ->  Revised_PixVoxel_Wargame/standing_frames/
#
# Usage:  tools/build_pixvoxel_atlases.sh [--check] <path-to-standing_frames>
#
# Writes assets/tiles/units_atlas.png outright, and repaints the property
# columns of assets/tiles/terrain_atlas.png (which tools/generate_tiles.gd
# leaves as bare grounds): city/base/hq rows 0-2 from the PixVoxel pack,
# airport/port and every building's iron/verdant row from the vendored sprites
# under assets/sprites/iso_buildings (the pack has no hangar, no quay, and no
# iron or verdant palette). Run it after the `ground` step; see the `sprites`
# target in the Makefile. Both steps are idempotent — the building columns are
# rebuilt from a freshly drawn base rather than composited onto themselves.
#
# --check validates this step's own inputs (ImageMagick and the source sprites)
# and exits without writing anything, so `make tiles` can prove the step will
# succeed before the destructive `ground` step strips the committed building art
# out of the working tree. It deliberately does not inspect terrain_atlas.png,
# which `ground` is about to rewrite.
#
# The 36 sprites it reads are vendored under assets/sprites/pixvoxel_src, so the
# default path in the Makefile works on a fresh clone.
#
# Requires ImageMagick 7 (`brew install imagemagick`).
