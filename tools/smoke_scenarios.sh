# Presentation smoke check: boots the battle scene once per demo scenario and
# proves each one still reaches its capture.
#
# This is deliberately NOT a GUT suite. GUT stays limited to core/ and ai/,
# which are Node-free; the battle scene is verified by driving it. Each demo
# runs the real handlers a player's input reaches (see _run_demo in
# battle_scenario_driver.gd), so a scenario that stops producing a frame means
# the flow it exercises has broken — a menu never opened, a state was never
# reached, or the scene crashed on the way.
#
# Usage:  tools/smoke_scenarios.sh [mode ...]   (see the `smoke` target)
#
# A mode may carry a `+fog` suffix — `victory+fog` is the victory scenario run
# with fog of war on. Fog is the one setting under which this scene *hides*
# units rather than merely drawing them, so a couple of fogged runs are part of
# the sweep; the mode name is the label and the capture filename, so a failure
# says which of the two it was.
#
# With no arguments it runs DEFAULT_MODES. Captures land in a temporary
# directory that is removed on exit unless SMOKE_KEEP is set, in which case the
# path is printed so the frames can be eyeballed.
#
# Needs a display: these runs render. They are not headless, so this is a local
# gate, not something to wire into a headless CI job as-is.

# One per branch of the interaction flow: targeting preview and resolved
# combat, capture, the build menu and a completed build, the map menu and the
# turn it ends, the load/drive/drop transport chain, supply, a Command Power
# fired from the HUD over an open menu, victory, and a full AI turn.
#
# Two of them run again under fog, where the sprite-hiding path exists at all:
# powermenu+fog fires a power, which redraws every sprite on the board at once,
# and victory+fog edits the sim behind the scene's back and resyncs. Both used
# to leak enemy positions.
#
# ambush and vanish turn fog on themselves — they are the same board with Sable
# Wren's power down and up, and only the second one may hide anything. Running
# both is what keeps `vanish` honest: a board that hid those units for some
# unrelated reason would pass on its own, but it would take `ambush` down with
# it.
# The commander-identity captures (power_ready/active/banner, commander_info and
# commander_victory) are the G3 gate: the HUD chip's charging/ready/active
# states, the activation card, the both-sides info sheet, and the victory lockup,
# each proved to still render at native 640x360.
#
# The `cutin` family is the odd one out: every other mode drives the flow and
# photographs what it produces, but the battle cut-in is deliberately suppressed
# while capturing (a mid-tween frame is what made the camera shake
# undeterministic), so these pose the overlay at a fixed moment of its own clock
# instead. They are still real checks — each runs the real resolver and the real
# staging, so a cut-in that stopped rendering, or a unit or terrain it could not
# draw, fails here rather than in play.
#
# `cutin[_ko][:<attacker>:<defender>]` stages any matchup on whatever board the
# run was launched with, which is what makes "all eighteen units stage
# correctly" checkable. The ones below are one per branch with its own code:
# survival and the kill, a bombing run from the air, a torpedo across the water,
# a shot at a submarine — the one target the roster hides — and an indirect
# attack, which is the only case that frames a volley with no counter coming
# back. cutin_skip is a test rather than a picture; see _spam_skip.
#
# Every one of those runs commander-less, though, and a commander-less side draws
# in the row its slot number names — so for a while none of them could see a
# cut-in surface reading a team int where an atlas row belongs (COM-10: Iron
# armies came out Aurora blue). The two `_iron_commander` variants close that:
# they stage Iron against Verdant, rows 3 and 4, neither equal to its slot, so a
# frame that resolves an army's colour any way but through SideIdentity is a
# frame with the wrong paint on it.
