## Paints placeholder art into the columns of assets/tiles/units_atlas.png that
## still have none — the units the CC0 PixVoxel pack does not cover and no hand
## authored sprite has replaced yet.
##
## Run it after tools/build_pixvoxel_atlases.sh (see the `tiles` target in the
## Makefile): it reads the atlas that step wrote, widens the canvas to whatever
## data/units/*.tres now asks for, and repaints only the columns PLACEHOLDER_IDS
## names. Every other column is copied across byte-identical. Idempotent — those
## columns are repainted from scratch, so running it twice is the same as once.
##
## The art is deliberately placeholder: flat 16px silhouettes in the team colour,
## drawn from the ASCII grids below so a shape can be read and edited in the
## source. They are here so a milestone is never blocked on art.
##
## Retiring a placeholder is one edit: drop the unit's id from PLACEHOLDER_IDS
## (and its grid from SPRITES) once real art occupies its column, and this script
## will preserve that column instead of overwriting it. Ownership is an explicit
## list rather than a "column N and up" watermark because real art has landed
## non-contiguously before — missiles at column 13 stayed a placeholder long
## after columns 9-12 and 14-17 got theirs, and a watermark cannot describe a
## hole. The list is empty today (missiles was the last placeholder; its column
## is real art from tools/paste_unit_sprites.gd now), so the script's whole job
## is the final invisible-column audit below.
