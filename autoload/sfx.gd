## Sfx.play(&"shot"). Missing streams are silently skipped so a headless
## run or a stripped build never breaks.

const SFX_DIR := "res://assets/sfx"
## The last three belong to the battle cut-in's weapon styles — a BattleStyle
## names the sound its volley makes, and these are the ones that wanted a voice
## of their own rather than the generic `shot`. A style may name a sound that has
## not been generated yet: `play` skips a missing stream in silence, which is
## what lets a new style ship before its wav does. The other two directions are
## linted in tests/unit/test_battle_styles.gd: every style names a sound on this
## list, and every wav on disk is on it.
